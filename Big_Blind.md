-From the title "Big Blind" I assumed this was some kind of Blind Injection, probably SQL, but I didn't want to assume anything.
-Sending a single ' returned a 500 internal server error, backing up my theory that it was probably blind SQL injection.

-After trying a few different things, using the sleep function didn't return an error, but didn't seem to do anything.
I tried other waiting commands like WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10', dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10) and pg_sleep(10), however, all of these returned errors. 
This meant that it was probably either SQLlite or MySQL.

-I then tested GLOB, a function that is in SQLlite but not MySQL, this returned an error, suggesting that it was MySQL

-Because the database was MySQL, I knew that SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE,(SELECT table_name FROM 
information_schema.tables),'a') would trigger an error if true, and put it into a python script to attempt to expose 
the database's contents.

-I used the script to determine the tablename (users) from information_schema.tables, then determined the column names 
(user, pass) from information_schema.columns, and then finally enumerated the username and password (admin, the flag)

-The script is here, I modified it to make it run for each different function, and in this form it is configured for 
enumerating the flag, which was the last time I used it(sorry if its a bit messy):
