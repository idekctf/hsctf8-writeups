## Solution:
The descriptions hints at finding an old profile picture for the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZq81jZcdjAHQJ3UtAbdaA) we found in c-brother-1. To do so, I used the Wayback Machine on all the pages on the channel. Eventually, I found this link: https://web.archive.org/web/20210614150352if_/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZq81jZcdjAHQJ3UtAbdaA/about, where the profile picture seemed to be the flag.

It was a bit hard to read, so I right-clicked the profile picture to get: https://web.archive.org/web/20210614150354/https://yt3.ggpht.com/Ug17FJY-SiCjr5JuAR_JIcBtmoUirZ2g6lVzm3NstW2K9gH5aH1jbuDaYF36-f4jdtTzd95f=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj. 
I copied the portion of the link after "https://web.archive.org/web/20210614150354/" and changed "s88" to "s500" to see:
