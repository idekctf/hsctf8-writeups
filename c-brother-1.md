## Description:
AC01010 and JC01010's long lost twin has joined the [HSCTF discord](https://discord.gg/C9UMj3qN8a) and started a Youtube channel! Although they haven't uploaded any videos, they've made some customizations to some of their video watermarks.

## Solution:
I first went to the discord server and searched for '01010' and found the user BC01010. A [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZq81jZcdjAHQJ3UtAbdaA) was connected to the profile, but since there were no videos uploaded, I couldn't easily extract the watermark. After doing some research on channel watermarks, I found that this is the generic form for the watermark link: i.ytimg.com/an/{channelId}/featured_channel.jpg. The channel id can be found easily as it is the text after "UC" in https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZq81jZcdjAHQJ3UtAbdaA. After inserting the channel id in the generic watermark link, we see:
