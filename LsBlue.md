## Writeup for misc/LsBlue ##


--Problem:
Orca watching is an awesome pastime of mine!
Downloads: lsblue.png


--Solution:
From the category of this problem, we know that it is in the misc/forensic category. So, the first step I tried was to download the image and open it up in a hex editor to analyze the metadata. No flag. My next attempt was to run a stego tool on the image. Since the image is a png I went with my favorite tool; Zsteg. 

-Below is the command used in my shell: zsteg -a lsblue.png

The output gave me tons of crap to sift through but I'm lazy and didn't want to do that, so with a quick grep command for flag{. We were able to modify the command and get the flag.

-New command: zsteg -a lsblue.png | grep "flag{"
-Output: b1,b,lsb,xy         .. text: "flag{0rc45_4r3nt_6lu3_s1lly_4895131}"

And there it is!

--Flag: flag{0rc45_4r3nt_6lu3_s1lly_4895131}
